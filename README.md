## Hello from Britanny (France)! 😄

Discovering the world of dev and coding as a support dev with Clever Cloud ! ✌


- 🔭 I’m currently working on (slowly) improving Clever Cloud documentation
- 🌱 I’m currently learning dev and github management as a whole ! 
- ⚡ Fun fact: i started from OSI layer 1, cabling DSL to houses & buildings, went through 2, 3, and 4 for networking & VOIP, then all the way up 👷 -> 🧑‍💻
